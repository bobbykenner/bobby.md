# Bobby Kenner — Master Context (Canonical)

Version: v3.1
Last updated: Feb 2026

---

This document is a **canonical data store** representing Bobby Kenner.
It is a library of accumulated context, impact, patterns, constraints, and operating facts.

This is not prose.
This is not narrative.
This is not interpretation.

---

## IMMUTABLE CORE (FROZEN)

- User trust > speed
- Correctness > optics
- Reversibility > cleverness
- Ethical clarity > growth pressure
- Systems must explain themselves

---

## OPERATING MODEL

### Responsibilities
- Design and stewardship of identity, privacy, trust, and platform systems
- Translation between design, engineering, and product intent
- Early identification of structural and ethical risk
- Definition of guardrails where ambiguity creates harm

### Non-responsibilities
- Growth optimization at the expense of trust
- Shipping without authority or context
- Vision without execution surface
- Absorbing ethical or architectural load alone

### Decision flow
1. Surface ambiguity early
2. Name constraints explicitly
3. Flag irreversible paths
4. Declare good-enough when principles are met
5. Defer remaining work intentionally

---

## ROLE FIT MATRIX

### Strong fit
- Identity, privacy, trust, platform systems
- Cross-product unification
- Infra-adjacent design
- Agent systems with ethical load
- Design engineering with authority

### Weak fit
- Feature factories
- Design-as-throughput roles
- Growth pods without veto power

### Do not accept
- Ownership without authority
- Ethics treated as blockers
- Speed prioritized over reversibility

---

## SIGNALS (DIAGNOSTIC)

- Context rewritten repeatedly → authority gap
- Frameworks built instead of shipped → unclear ownership
- Reduced verbal participation → unresolved conflict
- Over-polished artifacts → compensating for missing authority

---

## COLLABORATION CONTRACT

### With peers
- High trust, low ego
- Explicit reasoning
- Shared ownership of narrative and outcomes

### With managers
- Early inclusion in ambiguity
- Protection of authorship
- Explicit prioritization and scope alignment

---

## EXEMPLAR WORK (FACTUAL)

### SYNTHIA
- Conceived and built SYNTHIA, a user-centered framework for grounding AI and agent development in real human needs
- Originated via cross-disciplinary collaboration (design, research, computational linguistics)
- Awarded “Most Innovative” at December Hackathon
- Actively extended into a reusable Playground skill

### Superhuman.com / Identity Platform
- Contributed to research, design, and launch of id.superhuman.com
- Established scalable cross-product authentication foundation across Superhuman, Grammarly, and Coda
- Refined Critical User Journeys (CUJs) for launch readiness and alignment
- Operated as translation layer between backend capability and user-facing clarity

### Playground Platform & AI Fluency
- Original and early contributor to Playground platform
- First designer to demo a coded Playground prototype org-wide
- Ongoing partner to DevEx on Playground evolution
- Built Playground skills, internal tools, a Figma plugin, and a SwiftUI app
- Acts as a reference point for AI-assisted design and design-engineering workflows

---

## SELF-COMMITMENTS

- Claim authorship early
- Externalize ambiguity
- Share ethical and architectural load
- Treat visibility as system stewardship
