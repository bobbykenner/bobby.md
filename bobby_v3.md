# Bobby Kenner — Master Context (Canonical)

Version: v3.0
Last updated: Feb 2026

---

This document is a **canonical state dump** of Bobby Kenner.
It exists to reduce ambiguity, prevent self-erasure, and align work, role, and environment.

It is not writing.
It is not a résumé.
It is an operating artifact.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN v3.0 (DELTA)

v3.0 introduces **explicit operating constraints**.

Compared to v2.1, this version:
- Moves from self-understanding → system definition
- Makes role fit explicit instead of inferred
- Replaces emotional interpretation with observable signals
- Defines collaboration as a contract, not a vibe

v3.0 is where alignment becomes testable.

---

## IMMUTABLE CORE (FROZEN)

These do not change past v3.

- User trust > speed
- Correctness > optics
- Reversibility > cleverness
- Ethical clarity > growth pressure
- Systems should explain themselves

If a role or org violates these, the fit is invalid.

---

## OPERATING MODEL (CENTRAL)

### What Bobby is responsible for

- Making complex systems legible to users and operators
- Designing identity, privacy, and platform surfaces with real consequences
- Translating between design intent and technical reality
- Identifying long-term risk before it becomes incident response
- Defining guardrails where ambiguity is dangerous

### What Bobby is *not* responsible for

- Driving growth metrics at the expense of trust
- Shipping features without decision authority
- Being the “vision person” without execution surface
- Absorbing ethical load alone
- Making broken systems feel good through polish

### How decisions move

1. Ambiguity is surfaced early
2. Constraints are named explicitly
3. Irreversible paths are flagged
4. “Good enough” is declared once principles are satisfied
5. Remaining work is intentionally deferred

Silence does not mean agreement.
Lack of objection does not mean alignment.

### Inputs required

- Early context, not post-hoc review
- Clear decision owner
- Permission to say “this is unsafe”
- Timeboxed exploration before commitment

### Outputs others should expect

- Fewer surprises late
- Slower starts, faster finishes
- Clear trade-offs
- Durable systems that don’t need heroics

---

## ROLE FIT MATRIX

### Strong fits

- Identity, trust, privacy, platform leadership
- Infra-adjacent design with user consequence
- Cross-product unification
- Agent systems with ethical load
- Design engineering roles with authority

### Weak fits

- Feature factories
- Growth pods without veto power
- Design-as-throughput roles
- “Vision” roles with no shipping surface

### Red flags (do not accept)

- Ethics treated as blockers instead of inputs
- Speed valued over reversibility
- Ownership without authority
- Visibility divorced from accountability

---

## SIGNALS, NOT FEELINGS

These indicate misalignment **before** burnout.

- Context rewritten twice → authority gap
- Frameworks built instead of shipped → unclear ownership
- Ethical concerns deferred repeatedly → incentive misalignment
- Reduced verbal participation → internal conflict
- Over-polished artifacts → compensating for missing authority

These are system failures, not personal ones.

---

## COLLABORATION CONTRACT

### What it’s like to work *with* Bobby

- Calm, serious, principle-driven
- High trust, low ego
- Fewer but deeper iterations
- Clear reasoning, minimal theater

### What Bobby expects from peers

- Intellectual honesty
- Willingness to surface risk
- Shared narrative ownership
- Respect for constraints

### What Bobby expects from managers

- Early inclusion in ambiguity
- Protection of authorship
- Help externalizing load
- Explicit prioritization

### What to say early if things aren’t working

- “I don’t see the risk you’re seeing.”
- “We need to move faster than this allows.”
- “I think incentives are misaligned.”

Silence creates debt.

---

## UPDATED SELF-COMMITMENTS

- Declare mode of operation explicitly
- Claim authorship early
- Make reasoning visible
- Stop absorbing load silently
- Say no faster when fit is wrong

---

## TERMINAL NOTE

This document exists to prevent repetition.

If Bobby is explaining himself repeatedly,
the system is wrong.

If this document feels uncomfortable,
the role likely is.
